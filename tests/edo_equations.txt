## 1 - The expressions are ruled by python syntax.
## 2 - the "y", "t", and "dy/dt" are reserved words to independent variables, time and ODE indication;
## 3 - ODE expressions needs START with "dy/dt" followed by its index "[i]".
## 4 - Other expressions will be readed, althought simple expressions (with the form: "x = number") has 
       considered as parameters expression
## 5 - The independent variables are expreesed as y[i] where i (index) indicate which variable
##     is being used.
## 6 - There are predefined functions.
