# ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

A Python library for modeling, simulation, and optimization of process systems based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

The library allows users to define ODE systems through text files or docstrings, solve them using numerical integration, visualize results, and perform parameter optimization against experimental data. It also includes common error metrics for model evaluation.

# üìñ Documentation

You can view the example and the API reference [here](#). Features are being gradually added to the documentation

# üì¶ Where to get it

The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: [kuka_lib](https://github.com/tenoriolms/procmodeling_lib)

Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the Python Package Index (PyPI):

```bash
pip install procmodeling
```

## üöÄ Basic Usage

```python
from procmodeling_lib import edo_functions

# Load system from text file
edo = edo_functions('equations.txt')

# Visualize the system
edo.show_equations()

# Solve the system
edo.solve(t_span=[0, 10], y0=[1.0, 0.0])

# Optimize parameters
edo.optimize(
    data=my_dataframe,
    initial_values_columns=['A', 'B'],
    target_values_columns=['A', 'B'],
    time_column='time',
    bounds={'k1': (0, 1), 'k2': (0, 1)}
)
```
